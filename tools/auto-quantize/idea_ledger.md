### exp-20260703-001: Float-space centroid training → int8 snap at end
**Hypothesis**: The K-means bottleneck is rounding centroids to int during each iteration.
By training centroids in float space (no rounding) and only snapping to nearest odd-int at the very end,
K-means can discover optimized centroid positions that better match the weight distribution.
This avoids the "gravity" that pulls centroids back to {1,3,5} every iteration.

**Expected**: KL reduction of 5-15% since centroids can now take values like {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} rather than just {1,3,5}.

### exp-20260703-002: Activation-weighted K-means with imatrix
**Hypothesis**: Current weight sampling ignores activation importance. By using the imatrix
importance values as K-means sample weights, centroids will be biased toward high-activation
weight positions, reducing output distortion.

**Expected**: KL reduction of 3-10%.

### exp-20260703-003: Residual quantization — second pass refines grid
**Hypothesis**: After the first pass of quantization, compute the residual error and run a second
K-means pass on the residual. This allows the grid to adapt to quantization artifacts.

**Expected**: KL reduction of 5-15%.
