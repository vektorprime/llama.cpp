### exp-20260703-001: Float-space centroid training → int8 snap at end
**Hypothesis**: The K-means bottleneck is rounding centroids to int during each iteration.
By training centroids in float space (no rounding) and only snapping to nearest odd-int at the very end,
K-means can discover optimized centroid positions that better match the weight distribution.
This avoids the "gravity" that pulls centroids back to {1,3,5} every iteration.

**Expected**: KL reduction of 5-15% since centroids can now take values like {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} rather than just {1,3,5}.

### exp-20260703-002: Activation-weighted K-means with imatrix
**Hypothesis**: Current weight sampling ignores activation importance. By using the imatrix
importance values as K-means sample weights, centroids will be biased toward high-activation
weight positions, reducing output distortion.

**Expected**: KL reduction of 3-10%.

### exp-20260703-003: Residual quantization — second pass refines grid
**Hypothesis**: After the first pass of quantization, compute the residual error and run a second
K-means pass on the residual. This allows the grid to adapt to quantization artifacts.

**Expected**: KL reduction of 5-15%.

### exp-20260703-004: Multi-round error-aware refinement (RESULT: NO CHANGE)
**Hypothesis**: After the initial error-aware int8 snap, re-assign samples to snapped centroids and do ±1 gradient descent per dimension for 2-3 rounds. This could escape local minima and find better centroid values.

**Result**: KL = 0.970904 (identical to exp-003). The multi-round refinement found no improvements — the error-aware snap already finds near-optimal integer values. This suggests the K-means assignment + error-aware snap is already at a fixed point.

**Lesson**: The grid values are already locally optimal. To improve further, we need structural changes (per-type grids, scale refinement) rather than local search.

### exp-20260703-005: Per-tensor-type codebooks (PENDING)
**Hypothesis**: Separate shared grids for attention (attn_*) vs MLP (ffn_*) tensors, since they have different magnitude distributions. Grids are refined across all tensors of the same type.

**Expected**: KL reduction of 2-5%.

### exp-20260703-006: Gradient-based super-block scale refinement (PENDING)
**Hypothesis**: After quantization, refine super-block scale d via weighted least squares to minimize reconstruction error. This is a 1-D closed-form optimization.

**Expected**: KL reduction of 1-3%.
